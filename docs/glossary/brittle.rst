Brittle
=======

Brittleness is a property of tests which renders them liable to break easily under benign conditions. Brittle tests exhibit false positives - test failures that occur when there is no bug.

Brittleness can also often lead to test :doc:`indeterminacy`.

Examples of brittleness include :doc:`sleep_oriented_testing` or the use of xpaths.
