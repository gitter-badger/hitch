Loose coupling
==============

In computing and systems design a loosely coupled system is one in which each
of its components has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the
definitions of other separate components. Sub-areas include the coupling of
classes, interfaces, data, and services.

See: `Loose coupling wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling>`_.

Applied to tests
----------------

Tightly coupled tests are tests that require more rewriting when refactoring
code.

Loosely coupled tests can be left the same when refactoring code.

See (TODO):

* Unit testing of integration code: antipattern.
* Integration testing of algorithmic code: antipattern
