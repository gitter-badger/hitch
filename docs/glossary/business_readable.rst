Business readable
=================

Business readable is a term used by the :doc:`behavior_driven_development` community to mean a language that can be read and understood by "the business". This in essence means computer code that is close enough to English that it can be understood by a *non-programmer*.

Business readable does not mean:

* That the language is necessarily easy for "the business" to write.
* That the language is easily understood by a layman. Business readable still assumes a requisite level of domain knowledge and an understanding of specialist terminology.

Hitch tests aim to allow for writing tests that are both as business readable where possible and :doc:`DRY`.
